# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions - using Rust


This repository contains my [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) solutions in **Rust**. I originally started in Python but switched to Rust after Day 5. I'd been meaning to get more serious about Rust for a while, and AoC seemed like the perfect excuse to dive deeper than just reading the Rust documentation.


## Clone the Repository
